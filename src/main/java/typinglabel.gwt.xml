<!-- To compile to Gwt, you need to reference this file in your master .gwt.xml
     file (usually called GdxDefinition.gwt.xml) as follows:

     <inherits name="typinglabel" />
     
     You will also need to add a dependency on RegExodus in your GWT project (it might be useful to have in core, but it
     isn't at all necessary). The Gradle dependencies for GWT are:
     
     api "com.github.tommyettinger:regexodus:0.1.10"
     api "com.github.tommyettinger:regexodus:0.1.10:sources"
     
     If you want it in core as well,  you can move the first line to core's dependencies, but keep the second in GWT.
